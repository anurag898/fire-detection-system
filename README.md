# fire-detection-system

   “Fire Detecting System” will help in detecting fire or smoke at an early stage and can       
   help in saving lives. 
   We have designed a “Fire Detecting System” using temperature and smoke sensor which would   
   not only signal the presence of fire in a particular premise but will also send related information 
   through SMS.
   This systems does not require any human interaction.
   With the help of IoT and GSM module we can instantly send alert message to fire stations and 
   users.
